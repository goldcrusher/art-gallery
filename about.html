                    I believe every brushstroke tells a story, each decision an artist makes in their work tells the story of their life, their practice, and their learning.
                    I look to the past and human history, of the works of the great masters that came before us, to inspire my work, and let out my imagination.

                    My art is a reflection of my mind. Just as people grow and change, my art style evolves, continuously developing as I learn, experience, and explore what the world has to offer. Creating art makes me happy. I draw my interests, because it’s simply fun! I love art, and I hope to keep learning and improving over time. I just want to create and enjoy the process.

                <p>
                   My entire body of work, encompassing these various pieces, reveals a consistent preoccupation with exploring the power found in contrast. I am fascinated by how opposing forces such as light and shadow, quiet contemplation and vibrant energy, or vulnerability and fierce protection coexist to define a subject. By isolating these different elements, I aim to show that complexity isn't a weakness; rather, it's the fundamental source of human dignity and strength. Ultimately, my art is a quiet meditation on the intricate relationship between inner complexity and personal resilience.

                <p>
                    Based on my works, color is a fundamental element in art that significantly influences appreciation. Many individuals are drawn to vibrant artworks, while others prefer the subtlety of muted tones, leading to the continued production of both colorful and black-and-white or monochrome pieces.
